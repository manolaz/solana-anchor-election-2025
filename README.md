# Anchor Election 2025 (aka Voting app)

## ðŸ†• Updated for Solana Kit, Kite, and Codama

[![CI Badge](https://github.com/solana-kite/anchor-election-2025/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/solana-kite/anchor-election-2025/actions)

A new version of [onchain voting from the Anchor docs](https://examples.anchor-lang.com/docs/onchain-voting). 

> A decentralized onchain voting system on Solana, where users can vote on their favourite greeting

Note that like [the original](https://github.com/coral-xyz/anchor-by-example/blob/master/programs/onchain-voting/programs/onchain-voting/src/lib.rs), we do allow multiple votes!

This repo provides:

- Full compatibility with the latest Rust, Agave CLI, Node.js, Anchor, and Solana Kit.
- Clean builds with zero warnings or errors.
- Testing via npm and Node.js, avoiding third-party package managers or test runners.
